# A Very Pink Blog Template

 My mockup of a personal blog website.

 I transferred one of my Medium articles on [stacks and queues](https://medium.com/@angeloacebedo/data-structures-stacks-and-queues-7cc8790b9ce8) to a personalized blog template. It is coded in pure HTML and CSS, and separated by the **homepage** and **article page.**
